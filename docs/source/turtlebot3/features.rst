WORLD’S MOST POPULAR ROS PLATFORM
---------------------------------
TurtleBot is the world’s most popular open source robot for education and research. The new generation 'TurtleBot3' is a small, low cost, fully programmable, ROS based mobile robot. It is intended to be used for the purpose of education, research, product prototyping, and hobby application.

LOW COST
--------
TurtleBot was built for the cost-conscious needs from the educations and the proto-type research & developments. TurtleBot3 is the most affordable robot among the SLAM-able mobile robots equipped with a general 360-degree LiDAR.

SMALL SIZE
----------
The size of the TurtleBot3 BURGER is 176mm x 138mm x 188mm (L x W x H). Its size is about 1/4 of the size of the TurtleBot 1, 2. Try to imagine that the TurtleBot can be carried into the backpack.

ROS STANDARD
------------
The TurtleBot brand is managed by `Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc. (OSRF)`_, which develops and manages ROS. Nowadays, ROS has become the go-to platform for all the roboticists around the world. The TurtleBot obviously can be integrated by the existing ROS-based robots, but basically can be an affordable platform for whom want to get started learning ROS.

STRUCTURAL EXTENSIBILITY
------------------------
TurtleBot3 encourages users to customize its mechanical structure themselves using some alternative options: the open-source embedded board (as a control board), the computer, and the sensor. The Turtlebot3 BURGER is a two-wheeled differential drive type platform, but is able to be structurally and mechanically customized in many ways: the Cars, the Bikes, the Trailers and so on. Extend the ideas beyond the imagination.

MODULAR ACTUATOR FOR MOBILE ROBOT
---------------------------------
TurtleBot3 allows to get precise spatial data by using 2 Dynamixels in the wheel joints. The Dynamixel X series can be operated by one of 6 operating modes: the Velocity control mode for wheels, the Torque control mode or the Position control mode for joint, etc. The Dynamixel can be used even to make a mobile manipulator, since it is light but can be precisely controlled with the velocity, the torque and the position. The Dynamixel is a core component that makes the TurtleBot be completed.

OPEN CONTROL BOARD FOR ROS
--------------------------
The control board which is open-sourced in hardware wise and in software wise for ROS communication, or also called OpenCR, has the bandwidth to support not only for controlling the Dynamixel but also the ROBOTIS sensors which are frequently being used for basic recognition tasks in a cheaper way, such as Touch sensor, Infrared sensor, Color sensor and so on. It has a IMU sensor inside the board so that it can strengthen many precise controls. The board has a 3.3V, 5V, 12V power supplies to reinforce the available computer device lineups.


STRONG SENSOR LINEUPS
---------------------
TurtleBot3 BURGER uses a 360° LiDAR. The TurtleBot3 WAFFLE model is equipped with the 360° Lidar as well, but additionally proposes a powerful Intel® RealSense™ with the recognition SDK. This will be the best solution for making a mobile robot.

OPEN SOURCE
-----------
TurtleBot3's Hardware, Firmware, and Software are provided as open-sources. Basically, all components of the TurtleBot3 will be provided as the injection molded, and it achieves the low cost, but the CAD data for 3D printing is also available.
The CAD data is released to the Onshape, which is a full-cloud 3D CAD editor. Get access through a web browser by using the computer or even by the portable devices. Here allows the works of drawing, assemblying with the co-workers.
Besides, all details of the OpenCR board that are necessary for the users who want to make it by themselves, including the Schematics, the PCB Gerber, the BOM and the Firmware source are fully opened under the open-source licenses for the user and the ROS community.
